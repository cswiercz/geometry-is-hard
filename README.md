# cmesh

## Installation

The usual works:

    $ python setup.py install

or

    python setup.py install --user

if you don't want to mess around with your system Python. Alternately, if you
want to play around in the directory, you can do

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

and all of the Python / Cython modules will be built in-place.
